## What is Natural Lenguage Processing?

Area of reasearch in computer science and AI concerned with processing natural languages such as Portuguese or Mandarim. This processing generally involves translating natural language into data (numbers).


## What is a Natural Language Processing System?

Is often referred to as a **pipeline because it usually involves several stages** of processing where natural language flows in one end and the processed output flows out the other.


## What about the speech recognition systems?

Requires a lot of high quality labeled data, voice recordings annotated with their phonetic spellings, and natural language transcriptions aligned with the audio files. **The data collecting to build this kind of system is a very important step.**


## Afirmatives

- Natural Languages can't be directly translated into a precise set of mathematical operations, but they do contain information and instructions that can be extracted.
- Machines are better to recognize sarcasm in a isolated twitter message than humans.
- Humans are better within an ongoing dialog, **ability to maintain information about the context of statement.**
- Semantic analysis, along with stats, can help resolve the ambiguity of natural language.
- There is no **'theory of mind'** you can point to in an NLP pipeline. Theory of mind is like a human that have sufficient knowlodge about something and is possible to answer based on very little information.


### 1.3 **Applications:**

- An estimated 20% of the tweets about the 2016 US presidential election were composed by chatbots.
- Many reviews are the creation of autonomous NLP pipelines that have never set foot in a movie theater.


### 1.4 Language through a computer's 'eyes'

- An FSM -> regular expression
- Regular Expressions are simples comparing to NLP state-of-art solutions, but those can be useful to recognize a key phrase or command to unlock a particular action or behavior.
- A machine that processes this kind of language (regular expressions) can be thought of as a formal mathematical object called a **finite state machine** or **deterministic finite automation**.

Natural languages:

- Are not regular
- Are not context-free
- Can't be defined by any formal grammar
